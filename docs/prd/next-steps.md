# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Create the UX architecture and design system for the Policy Aggregator MVP based on this PRD. Focus on the email-first workflow and simple admin interface. The design should prioritize functionality and trust over visual polish - "boring is good." Key screens to design: login, dashboard, route management, source configuration, change history, and change detail/diff view. Use this PRD as the complete requirements source.

### Architect Prompt

Create the technical architecture document for the Policy Aggregator MVP based on this PRD. Design the system architecture, data model, API structure, and deployment strategy. Key technical decisions: Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, plugin-based source fetchers, versioned policy storage, and GitHub Actions for scheduling. Ensure the architecture supports the 6-8 week build timeline and avoids rework later. Use this PRD as the complete requirements source.
