# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Deliver a route-scoped regulatory change monitoring MVP (India → Germany, Student + Work visas) that triggers payment within 10-12 weeks
- Provide credible early warning with proof of monitoring (source attribution, timestamps, diffs) to enable defensible compliance decisions
- Build a technical architecture that ships in 6-8 weeks while avoiding rework later (versioned policy store, plugin-based fetchers)
- Validate business model with 2-3 paid pilots (€199-€299) to confirm pain, pricing, and delivery before scaling
- Establish systematic, auditable monitoring that replaces manual, error-prone processes for immigration consultancies and global mobility teams

### Background Context

Immigration consultancies and global mobility teams discover policy changes too late, leading to costly rework, client escalations, and reputational damage. Manual monitoring via junior staff checking 5-15 government sites is labor-intensive, error-prone, and impossible to audit. When policies change mid-application, entire application sections become invalid, requiring unbillable rework and damaging client trust.

This is a risk-mitigation purchase, not a productivity tool. The core value proposition is: "We ensure you are never surprised by a regulatory change on the routes you handle." Customers pay for early warning with proof, not perfect prediction. The MVP focuses on India → Germany routes (Student + Work visas) with 3-5 official sources, delivering route-scoped monitoring, authoritative source tracking with timestamps, change detection with diffs, and proactive email alerts.
