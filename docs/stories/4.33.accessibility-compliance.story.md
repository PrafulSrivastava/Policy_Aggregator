## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- All previous stories created components
- Design system uses high contrast (black/white) which helps accessibility
- Need to ensure all components are accessible

### Design System
[Source: .ignore/design_prompt.md]

**Accessibility Considerations:**
- High contrast design (black/white) meets WCAG AAA
- Sharp corners and clear borders help visibility
- Focus indicators: 3px solid outline with offset

### File Locations
- All component files - Update for accessibility
- `frontend/src/components/SkipLink.tsx` - Create skip link component
- `frontend/src/pages/Legal/Accessibility.tsx` - Create accessibility statement (optional)

### Technical Constraints
- Must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators must be visible

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Location:** `frontend/src/__tests__/accessibility/`

**Testing Tools:**
- axe DevTools
- WAVE browser extension
- Lighthouse accessibility audit
- Manual keyboard testing
- Screen reader testing
