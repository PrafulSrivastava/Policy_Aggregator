# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Repository Structure

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** admin/developer,  
**I want** a properly structured monorepo with development tooling,  
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the application with clear organization and development workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Repository initialized with Git, proper `.gitignore` for Python projects
2. Directory structure created: `fetchers/`, `api/`, `admin-ui/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `docs/`
3. Python virtual environment setup documented
4. Basic `requirements.txt` with core dependencies (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
5. README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and development guidelines
6. Basic CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions) for running tests (placeholder for now)
7. Environment variable template file (`.env.example`) with required variables documented

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
N/A - This is the first story in EPIC 1.

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

The project follows a monorepo structure with the following key directories:
- `api/` - FastAPI backend application
- `admin-ui/` - Frontend templates and static assets (Jinja2)
- `fetchers/` - Plugin-based source fetchers
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts for development and operations
- `tests/` - Test suite organization (unit, integration, fixtures)
- `docs/` - Documentation (PRD, Architecture, etc.)
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD and scheduled jobs
- `alembic/` - Database migrations (will be created in Story 1.2)

### Tech Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Backend:**
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI 0.104+
- SQLAlchemy (async support)
- Alembic for migrations
- Pydantic for validation
- pytest 7.4+ for testing
- uvicorn for ASGI server

**Development Tools:**
- Git for version control
- Python virtual environment
- pip + requirements.txt for dependency management
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Files to create in this story:
- `.gitignore` - Root directory
- `requirements.txt` - Root directory
- `README.md` - Root directory
- `.env.example` - Root directory
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- Directory structure: `fetchers/`, `api/`, `admin-ui/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` (with subdirectories)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Environment Variables:** Always access environment variables through a config module (will be created in Story 1.4), never use `os.getenv()` directly.

**File Naming:**
- Python files: `snake_case.py`
- Test files: `test_*.py` (pytest convention)

**Git Commit Standards:**
- Use present tense: "Add route subscription endpoint"
- Be descriptive
- Branch naming: `feature/add-route-subscription`, `fix/change-detection-edge-case`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`

**Test Execution:**
- Run tests with `pytest`
- Tests will be implemented in later stories
- CI/CD workflow should include test execution step (placeholder for now)

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.10+ required
- All dependencies must be compatible with Python 3.10+
- Virtual environment is required for development
- `.env` file should never be committed to Git (must be in `.gitignore`)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Location:** `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` directories

**Test Standards:**
- Use pytest framework
- Test files follow `test_*.py` naming convention
- Tests will be added in subsequent stories

**Testing Frameworks:**
- pytest 7.4+ for backend unit and integration tests
- Manual testing for MVP (no frontend unit tests needed)

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- No tests required for this story (setup only)
- CI/CD workflow should be configured to run tests (placeholder step)
